# Webiste-Portfolio

Hello!

This is literally just a webiste I built as a way to remember how to use HTML and CSS and the smallest amount of JavaScript.

I did not follow a lot of conventions as I really jsut wanted this website out fast for helping with job hunting. 

Feel free to use it! I don't care, take out my words and coloring and projects and put your own stuff in there! If you are new to webiste making I can certainly help if you reach out, I have all the time in the world and none of its money! There is a email button on the website.

Oh! I'm working on getting it secured, I don't know why its taking so long though. 

  -Michael


P.S. A mobile version is coming soon!
